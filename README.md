# Smart Lender - Applicant Credibility Prediction For Loan Approval

## Overview

One of the most important factors which affect our country’s economy and financial condition is the credit system governed by the banks. The process of bank credit risk evaluation is recognized at banks across the globe. “As we know credit risk evaluation is very crucial, there is a variety of techniques are used for risk level calculation. In addition, credit risk is one of the main functions of the banking community.
The prediction of credit defaulters is one of the difficult tasks for any bank. But by forecasting the loan defaulters, the banks definitely may reduce their loss by reducing their non-profit assets, so that recovery of approved loans can take place without any loss and it can play as the contributing parameter of the bank statement. This makes the study of this loan approval prediction important. Machine Learning techniques are very crucial and useful in the prediction of these types of data.
We will be using classification algorithms such as Decision tree, Random forest, KNN, and xgboost. We will train and test the data with these algorithms. From this best model is selected and saved in pkl format. We will be doing flask integration

## Features

- **Web Interface**: The `Web Interface` directory contains the code for the Flask web application. Users can interact with the trained model through this interface.

- **Model Development**: The `loan_prediction.ipynb` notebook int model-building directory of the project development phase includes the code for developing and training the model. It provides detailed explanations of the model architecture and training process.

- **Dataset**: The `loan_prediction.csv` file in model-building directory contains the dataset used for training and testing the model. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions and rights to use and distribute the dataset.
## Data Set is also available in Kaggle which can be accessed using an API --> [Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/altruistdelhite04/loan-prediction-problem-dataset) 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Install dependencies like : Flask,Numpy,image,keras,tensorflow


### Running the Web Interface

1. Navigate to the `webapp-building` directory in the `Project Development Phase`.

2. Run the Flask application: using simple line of code : python app.py in the terminal at the same directory.

The web interface will be accessible at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) -> in your local host
you can even access the web app on other devices on the same network with the actual Ip given below the local host.
